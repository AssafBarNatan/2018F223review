    are not comfortable with.}.

          % tests isolating ambiguity and finding missing quantification
          A transformation $f\colon\R^n\to \R^m$ is linear if 
          it sends sums to sums, $f(\vec0) = \vec0$, and 
          $f(\alpha \vec x) = \alpha f(\vec x)$.

          % tests broad thinking to remember that a basis is necessary
          % tests mathematical convention
          An $n\times m$ matrix corresponds to a linear 
          transformation from $\R^n$
          to $\R^m$.

          $\vec w$ is a convex combination of $u$ and $v$ if:

      Sam has a function $T\colon\R^n\to \R^m$, which has the following
      property:

      A transformation $T:\R^n\to \R^m$ is called 
      \textit{almost linear} if for all $x,y\in \R^n$, and 
      $\alpha\ge 0$, we have 
      \begin{align*}
        \|T(x+y)\| &\le \|T(x)+T(y)\|\\

      % Jason said he didn't like the second part of this question?
      We define:
      \begin{equation*}
        A = 
        \begin{bmatrix}
          0 & 3 & 2 \\
          a & 0 & 0 \\

      \begin{enumerate}
        \item For which values of $a$ is 
          the matrix $A$ invertible? 
        \item What is the rank of $A$ when it is not invertible?
        \item In the above case, find a basis for the range 
          of the transformation $T_A(x) = Ax$.
      \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{(Eigenvalues \& Diagonalization; Similar Matrices; 
      Projections)}\\
      Let $T\colon\R^2\to\R^2$ be the transformation which 
      projects vectors onto the subspace $V=\Span\{\vec v\}$, 
      where $\vec v = \mat{1\\1}$.
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item Write $T$ in the standard basis, and in one other basis. 
          Which one do you prefer?
        \item Is $T$ one-to-one? Is $T$ onto?
        \item What are the eigenvectors of $T$? Is $T$ diagonalizable?
        \item Is $T$ invertible?
      \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{(Computational Objectives; Representations of Lines; 
      SLE)}\\
      Let $\vec a = \mat{-1\\0\\1}$ and $\vec b = \mat{1\\0\\0}$. 
      Define:
      \begin{align*}
        V = \left\{\vec x\in \R^2: %
        \left(\vec x - \mat{0\\0\\1}\right)\perp \vec a \text{ and } 
        \left(\vec x - \mat{0\\0\\1}\right)\perp \vec b\ \right\}
      \end{align*}
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item Write down a system of linear equations where 
          $V$ is the compelte solution set
        \item Write down the corresponding augmented matrix.
        \item Express $V$ in vector form.
        \item Express $V$ as the span or translated span of 
          vectors.

\begin{solutions}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Here are the things students should identify for 
      each question:
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item Dimension does not make sense in this context, and 
          the proper definition includes linear independence
        \item $=$ should be $\in$, and the `for all` makes no 
          sense there. Additionally, the condition is wrong. Students 
          should also be able to make this answer shorter.
        \item Students should replace $1$ with $\pm \|a\|\|b\|\|c\|$, 
          and do this by understanding that the unit cube is sent to 
          another cube.
        \item The word `eigenvalues` should be replaced with 
          `eigenvectors,` and even so, it does not make sense 
          for a matrix to have a basis. This question is quite 
          open-ended, and there are many directions the students 
          can take this.
      \end{enumerate}
    \item 
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item To show that a transformation $T$ is almost 
          linear, one needs to show that for any $x,y\in \R^n$ and 
          $\lambda \in \R$ such that $\lambda\ge 0$:
          \begin{itemize}
            \item $\|T(x+y)\| \le \|T(x)+T(y)\|$
            \item $\|T(\lambda x)\| \le \lambda \|T(x)\|$
          \end{itemize}
        \item Take $x = 2$ and $\lambda = 2$. Then 
          $\|f(\lambda x)\| = 16$, but 
          $\lambda \|T(x)\| = 2 \|4\| = 8$.
        \item In a linear transformation, the first condition 
          holds and is an equality. Now, let $\lambda \ge0$ be 
          given, and let $x\in \R^n$. Then by linearity:
          \begin{align*}
            \|T(\lambda x)\| = \|\lambda T(x)\|
            =|\lambda|\|T(x)\| = \lambda \|T(x)\|
          \end{align*}
          Showing almost linearity.
      \end{enumerate}
    \item
      \begin{align*}
        A = 
        \begin{bmatrix}
          0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
          0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
          1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
          0 & 0 & 0 & 1
        \end{bmatrix}
        \begin{bmatrix}
          1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
          0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
          0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
          1 & 0 & 0 & 1
        \end{bmatrix}
        \begin{bmatrix}
          1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
          0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
          0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
          0 & 0 & 1 & 0
        \end{bmatrix}
        \begin{bmatrix}
          1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
          0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
          0 & 0 & 3 & 0 \\
          0 & 0 & 0 & 1
        \end{bmatrix}
        \begin{bmatrix}
          1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
          0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
          0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
          0 & 0 & 0 & 2
        \end{bmatrix}
      \end{align*}
      and the determinant of $A$ is $6$.

  \subsection*{Session Objectives}
  We are pretty open about the fact that this session is 
  for students to find their weak spots. We are happy if 
  every student at least attempts every problem.

  \subsection*{What to Do}
  Unlike tutorials during the year, in this tutorial, it is 
  ok if students do not finish a question before moving on to 
  the next one. Walk around the room helping students for a 
  fixed time for each question. Encourage multiple-group 
  discussions, and allow groups to exchange ideas, like a 
  mini-tutorial. After the allotted time for a question, 
  there will be a short wrap-up. Rinse and repeat.

  Some students will want to skip ahead to do things they 
  either know how to do, or think they should practice. Try not 
  to let students do this, and instead offer them to discuss 
  with other groups.
  \subsection*{Notes}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Question 1 has math notation mistakes and math content 
      mistakes. Try to get each group to notice at least one of each.
    \item Students will struggle with question 2, and it's 
      important that they are able to do parts a) and c) for this 
      question.
    \item Question 3 can be done by inspection, but students should 
      do it by writing $A$ as a product of elementary matrices
    \item Question 4 can be done by inspection, but if students 
      insist on it being done this way, they should have a very 
      good explanation to go along.
    \item In Question 5 a), students might try to do some complicated 
      calculus to find the minimal distance. This will work, but the 
      shorter approach of using plane geometry is preferred.
  \end{itemize}
